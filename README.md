- **Product Catalog**: CRUD operations, inventory tracking, search/filtering
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart, quantity management, price calculations
- **Order Processing**: Complete lifecycle management, status tracking
- **Payment System**: Secure checkout simulation, multiple payment methods
- **Coupon Engine**: Flexible discount system with validation

### 🚀 Performance & Reliability
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-style in-memory caching for optimization
- **Stress Testing**: Load testing suite in `Stress_test/` directory
- **Transaction Safety**: ACID compliance simulation
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and logging

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming with SOLID principles
- **Patterns**: Factory, Observer, Strategy, Singleton, Repository
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, stress tests

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parthtiwari-dev/E-commerce-Simulation-System.git
   cd E-commerce-Simulation-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the simulation**
