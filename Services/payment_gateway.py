"""
Payment Gateway Simulation Module

Purpose:
    Simulates external payment processing for the e-commerce system.
    Provides methods for charging users, handling payment information, and returning
    payment success or failure status. Mimics real-world gateway behavior for credit card,
    debit card, wallet, or UPI transactions.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Validate payment information format.
    - Simulate payment approval, rejection, or timeout scenarios.
    - Integrate with order placement: only finalize an order after successful payment.
    - Log payment attempts, errors, and confirmations for audit/debug purposes.
    - Raise custom exceptions (e.g., PaymentFailedError) on failure.

Example Methods:
    process_payment(user, order, payment_info): Process and validate the payment for a given order.
    refund_payment(order, amount): Simulate refunding payment to a customer (optional).
    validate_payment_info(payment_info): Check if card/UPI/wallet info is well-formed.
    log_transaction(details): Log each payment event or error (optional).

Notes:
    This module simulates payment onlyâ€”it does not connect to real banks or gateways.
    Failures can be forced/randomized to test downstream error handling and rollback logic.
