"""
Transaction and Atomic Operation Utilities Module

Purpose:
    Provides context managers and helpers for atomic, all-or-nothing operations
    across inventory, payment, and order creation. Ensures system consistency
    by rolling back partial state changes on failure (inventory, payments, orders).

Key Responsibilities:
    - Handle atomic checkout workflows (reserve stock, process payment, finalize order)
      so that if any step fails, previous steps are safely rolled back.
    - Support "with" statement context for transactional blocks.
    - Integrate with logging and exception services for robust error handling.
    - Enable simulation of real-world transactional safety for bulk/stress testing.

Example Classes/Methods:
    TransactionContext: Context manager for atomic order placement.
    begin(): Manual transaction start.
    commit(): Commit all pending changes.
    rollback(): Revert all changes if a workflow step fails.
    run_atomic(func, *args, **kwargs): Run a function atomically with rollback-on-failure.

Notes:
    Critical for scaling reliabilityâ€”especially with concurrent checkouts,
    high traffic, or in a multi-threaded/bulk order simulation environment.
