Stress Test Runner Script

Purpose:
    Orchestrates mass operations (order placement, payment, cancellation, etc.)
    to simulate large user volume and identify system bottlenecks, race conditions, or performance issues.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Launch a configurable number of simulated checkouts/payment/cancellation in sequence or parallel.
    - Report timing, throughput statistics, and error rates under stress.
    - Exercise error handling, transaction safety, and system resilience.
    - Log major events and summary statistics for later analysis.

Example Methods:
    run_basic_stress_test():         Runs many random orders and reports outcome stats.
    run_concurrent_checkout_test():  (Optional) Launches operations in threads/processes for concurrency.
    print_summary():                 Prints aggregated results after test runs.

Notes:
    Only relevant for testing/benchmarkingâ€”should not be deployed in a real environment.
